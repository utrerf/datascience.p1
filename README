README
-------------------
In this repository there are 2 files that I created to complete Project 1 of the Data Science Nanodegree.

1. stroopdata.csv: contains data by subject, including time in seconds that it took to read a congruent and an incongruent list
2. project1.ipynb: contains data visualizations, statistical tests, results and conclusions
